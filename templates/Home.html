		<p class = "ctxt">"I love the EcoSecure software! A very good deterrent for burglers. We’ve had attempted break-ins in the past so decided to but the EcoSecure software on a old phone of mine as a security measure as well as having a camera system and burgler alarm. We had another attempted break in just last week at 3.30 in the morning whilst we were sleeping upstairs. They came up to the door and they must have heard the chimes go off in the house which made them ran away. It woke me up immediately and I had a quick look to see what set it off. Called the police straight away. I would hugely recommend this product to anyone, it just keeps my mind at ease when no one is in the house or we are sleeping upstairs." - Michel Taro </p>
