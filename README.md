# EcoSecure
 A simple application that uses a Python deep learning model in order to recognise and identify faces. The model interfaces with a HTML/CSS web dashboard using the Flask API in order to reflect the findings of the model. For instance, if an authenticated user (specified by the owner of the app) is detected, then it notifies the web dashboard of this. Conceived during Hack The Valley 4 (2020).

## Technologies
This project consists of a Python backend, which implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that recognises and identifies faces. The ML model interfaces with the HTML/CSS front end using the Flask API

## Requirements
This project requires the following libraries and frameworks:

* Flask v1.1.1
* numpy v1.18.1
* Pillow v7.0.0
* opencv-contrib-python v4.2.0.32
* face_recognition v1.2.3
* flask_sqlalchemy v2.4.1
* requests v2.22.0

In addition to the above, you will need Python (v3.6.8), HTML5 and CSS3. This has also been tested on Python v3.7.4 but newer versions may create issues

## Examples
Some sample screenshots of functionality the website would provide are shown below

## Status
As of February 2020 (last commit was the 16th), the project is active
